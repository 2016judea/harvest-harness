# Real Mobile Safari probe on a HEADLESS iOS Simulator — the tier the emulators
# cannot reach. Proven 2026-10-04: the pre-fix brickandmortar.dev address field
# zoomed iOS 27 to scale 1.33 and stayed there after the keyboard closed; the
# fixed page focused at scale 1.00.
#
#   sim_probe.sh <url> <out_dir> [tap_x tap_y]     # tap coords in POINTS (iPhone 17: 402x874)
#
# Needs: Xcode 27 (App Store; ~3.7 GB on disk is complete), the iOS runtime
# (`xcodebuild -downloadPlatform iOS`, 8 GB, registers despite a manifest error),
# idb for taps (`brew trust facebook/fb && brew install idb-companion`, client
# `pip install fb-idb`). Xcode 27 from the App Store ships NO
# Simulator.app, so there is no window to click; simctl renders headless and idb
# injects touches. The software keyboard DOES appear headless, and the focus zoom
# runs with it.
#
# Reading the result: compare 2-after-tap.png with 1-load.png. Bigger type and a
# right edge off-screen is the iOS zoom trap. For a number, load a page that prints
# `visualViewport.scale` (see zoomtest.html in this directory) — scale 1.33 = a
# 12px field, 1.00 = clean.
